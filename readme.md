A lot of people use ciphers to hide messages. This could be for giving out signals, warnings, or a fun little thing to prank your friends with! It is a way to communicate with others without other people managing to eavesdrop, as it has many different types in different languages! A lot of them are still being used to this day, so it's a wonder what each message sent by someone could possibly mean.
