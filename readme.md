# Introducing: 

A lot of people use ciphers to hide messages. 
This could be for giving out signals, warnings, or a fun little thing to prank your friends with! 
It is a way to communicate with others without other people managing to eavesdrop, as it has many different types in different languages! 
A lot of them are still being used to this day, so it's a wonder what each message sent by someone could possibly mean.
<br>This website aims for people to be able to recognize some of these ciphers, and to be used to decode and encode some of the existing ciphers in the world. 
In here, there will be multiple options for the user to use to decode ciphers, or maybe they want to encrypt their own messages, using the encode option.
If they wish to learn the history of the cipher or how it actually works, they can use the library, and look for the code they want to know about. 
Those are the basics of the website we want to achieve.
