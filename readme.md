# Introducing: 

A lot of people use ciphers to hide messages. 
This could be for giving out signals, warnings, or a fun little thing to prank your friends with! 
It is a way to communicate with others without other people managing to eavesdrop, as it has many different types in different languages! 
A lot of them are still being used to this day, so it's a wonder what each message sent by someone could possibly mean.
<br>This website aims for people to be able to recognize some of these ciphers, and to be used to decode and encode some of the existing ciphers in the world. 
In here, there will be multiple options for the user to use to decode ciphers, or maybe they want to encrypt their own messages, using the encode option.
If they wish to learn the history of the cipher or how it actually works, they can use the library, and look for the code they want to know about. 
Those are the basics of the website we want to achieve.

Our outline goes like this:
  
<ol>
  <li>Home Page</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For navigation</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Decoder</li>
  <ul>
    <li>For decoding ciphers</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Encoder</li>    
  <ul>
    <li>For encoding messages and encrypting them into ciphers</li>
  </ul>
    <li>Library</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Information Encyclopedia about different ciphers</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
You also have easy access to certain points in the library through the section in the side of the homepage, which is demonstrated in our wireframe for this website:

For the use of JS, we plan to use it for decoding and encoding messages. It will be used when changing the values of the original characters into new characters. It could also be for changing letters into numbers, and substituting letters into other letters, and maybe through the use of special characters. It really depends on the cipher being used and what it needs to produce.
