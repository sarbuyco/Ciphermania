    <p>
      We were inspired by a recent passion for ciphers and codes when making this website. 
      Our interest in the topic was primarily sparked by an animated show brimming with 
      mystery, secrets uncovered, and, well, ciphers. This enjoyment became the foundation 
      of Ciphermania.
    </p>
    <p>
      We decided we wanted to share this excitement with others and dove into research for 
      simple ciphers to explain in Ciphermania, for users to better understand with our 
      coding and decoding tools, and so we gathered five of our finding to hopefully spark 
      in others the same wonder and intrigue that was sparked in us. Ciphers are a most 
      interesting form of communication, and this is our respectful preservation and 
      sharing of the topic.
