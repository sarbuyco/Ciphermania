        A webpage showcasing the possible ciphers on this website. It gives the
        user a basic description of the cipher, and teaches them how they can
        decipher the code on their own. Here, people can browse and learn about
        the different kinds of ciphers that have been made possible to the world
        today.

            <h2 class="Ciheaders">Caesar Cipher</h2>
            <p class="Citext">
              A simple and classic way to encode messages. Caesar Cipher is a
              substitution cipher, meaning that the original letter will be
              replaced by another letter or symbol. Caesar involves shifting
              letters based on a certain key (a user input) and the shifted
              letter will be the original letter's encryptment. The most typical
              key for Caesar is 3.
              <br /><br />
              Method:
              <br />
              Let's say that the inputted text to decode was "Bill," and the
              shift key is 3. This means that A=D, B=E, C=F.
              <br />
              Encoded message:
              <br />

          <section id="Morse">
            <h2 class="Ciheaders">Morse Code</h2>
            <p class="Citext">
              A famous Cipher known for its dots and dashes. This can be used in
              any form, whether it be the flashing of light, the beeping of
              doors, steps, winks, hands, etc. It is a simple substitution
              cipher than can use 1-6 characters for just one original
              character, and each character/letter is a different, unique
              combination of dots and dashes/underscores, with slashes acting as
              a space. This, however, does not include lowercase letters, and
              all messages are decoded into uppercase.<br /><br />
              Method:
              <br />
              There is only one set of combinations for this cipher, meaning
              that it can be memorized, or referenced in a book or the internet.
              Let's say that we have the phrase, "I like triangles," and encode
              it into morse code.
              <br />
              Encoded message:
              <br />

            <h2 class="Ciheaders">Affine Cipher</h2>
            <p class="Citext">
              A cipher wherein each letter first corresponds to a number from
              0-25 (based on their order in the alphabet). Let this letter's
              corresponding number be x. Then, if your first key input number is
              a and your second key input number is b, a is multiplied to x and
              b is added to the product. Get this result and get the modulus of
              this divided by 26 (for the 26 letters of the English alphabet.)
              The resulting number/s is your encrypted message. Refer to the

            <p class="Citext">
              This cipher applies binary code into their function. But unlike
              normal binary, this cipher uses two letters to showcase the
              encrypted message rather than ones or zeroes. These two letters
              are commonly "a" and "b", and the binary string represents the
              index of the order of the alphabet (i.e. A is index 0, so the
              function shows "aaaaa"). The cipher uses no lowercase letters.
              Here is an example of how the binary string works and how it
              represents the index:

              This is how binary works, with a,b,c,d, and e either being 1 or 0,
              and is multiplied to the exponents of two above and added together
              to form the index number. In bacon, this string is represented by
              two letters instead of 1 or 0. Here is also a simple table on the
              keys of Bacon Cipher:

            <p class="Citext">
              This is based on the buttons of multitap phones. In a 12 button
              keypad, 8 of them (numbers 2-9) can be pressed a different number
              of times to correspond to a letter. So, in written code, the
              number of times a certain number is pressed corresponds to a
              letter of the alphabet. For example, C is 222 because you have to
              press the number 2 button three times to get the letter C when
              typing on a multitap phone SMS. Below is an image of the keypad of
              old phones that is used for reference for this cipher.
