        A webpage showcasing the possible ciphers on this website. It gives the
        user a basic description of the cipher, and teaches them how they can
        decipher the code on their own. Here, people can browse and learn about
        the different kinds of ciphers that have been made possible to the world

            <p class="Citext">
              A simple and classic way to encode messages. Caesar Cipher is a
              substitution cipher, meaning that the original letter will be
              replaced by another letter or symbol. Caesar involves shifting
              letters based on a certain key (a user input) and the shifted
              letter will be the original letter's encryptment. The most typical
              key for Caesar is 3.
              <br /><br />
              Method:
              <br />
              Let's say that the inputted text to decode was "Bill," and the
              shift key is 3. This means that A=D, B=E, C=F.
              <br />
              Encoded message:

            <h2 class="Ciheaders">Morse Code</h2>
            <p class="Citext">
              A famous Cipher known for its dots and dashes. This can be used in
              any form, whether it be the flashing of light, the beeping of
              doors, steps, winks, hands, etc. It is a simple substitution
              cipher than can use 1-6 characters for just one original
              character, and each character/letter is a different, unique
              combination of dots and dashes/underscores, with slashes acting as
              a space. This, however, does not include lowercase letters, and
              all messages are decoded into uppercase.<br /><br />
              Method:
              <br />
              There is only one set of combinations for this cipher, meaning
              that it can be memorized, or referenced in a book or the internet.
              Let's say that we have the phrase, "I like triangles," and encode
              it into morse code.
              <br />
              Encoded message:
              <br />

              Another simple substitution cipher, but this time involves the
              user thinking of a keyword. This keyword will then be placed in
              the front of the new substituted letters, and the letters that go
              after that will follow their basic alphabetical order. This does
              not have the use of lowercase letters. If there are duplicate
              letters in the word (i.e. BILLY), then the duplicate is removed
              (will be BILY).
              <br />
              An example of the cipher is this: imagine our keyword is PARTY.

              A slightly trickier substitution cipher that also involves a
              keyword. This is shown through a square where each column and row
              has a letter represented to them, and the letter is the first to
              be seen in the column/row. It still follows the alphabetical
              order, and the message will be encrypted by the column, and the
              keyword by the row. The intersection of column and row will be the
              substituted letter for the original letter. This only uses

              This cipher applies binary code into their function. But unlike
              normal binary, this cipher uses two letters to showcase the
              encrypted message rather than ones or zeroes. These two letters
              are commonly "a" and "b", and the binary string represents the
              index of the order of the alphabet (i.e. A is index 0, so the
              function shows "aaaaa"). The cipher uses no lowercase letters.
              Here is an example of how the binary string works and how it
              represents the index:

              This is based on the buttons of multitap phones. In a 12 button
              keypad, 8 of them (numbers 2-9) can be pressed a different number
              of times to correspond to a letter. So, in written code, the
              number of times a certain number is pressed corresponds to a
              letter of the alphabet. For example, C is 222 because you have to
